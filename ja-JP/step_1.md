## Introduction

In this project you will read data from a file to create robot trump cards. Then you can play Robo-Trumps with a friend.

## Introduction:

In this project learners will read data from a file into a dictionary, to create robot trump cards. The cards can then be used to play Robo-Trumps with a friend.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

* ['Robotrumps' starting point -- jumpto.cc/trumps-go](http://jumpto.cc/trumps-go)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

* [‘Robotrumps’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/9ccc368bd5](https://trinket.io/python/9ccc368bd5)

## Offline Resources

This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

* robotrumps/robotrumps.py
* robotrumps/cards.txt
* Several robot .gif images

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

* robotrumps-finished/robotrumps.py
* robotrumps-finished/cards.txt
* Several robot .gif images

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

* Consolidation: data structures, reading from file and turtle graphics;
* Using images in turtle graphics;
* Sharing trinket projects.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

* Add more robots - Editing a .txt file and working with images;
* Add more stats to the robots - handling data;
* Play Robotrumps with a friend.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* **Offline Python does not work with .png images. .gif images have been supplied for offline use.**
* Note that this project uses both text input and turtle graphics, you can adjust the amount of space given to each in trinket.
* You need to click in the trinket text window before typing.
* Children can use the 'Share' option in trinket to get a link to their project. If they have access to email then they can email the link to a friend, otherwise they can just read it out, note it down on a piece of paper or save it in a text file on the local network.
